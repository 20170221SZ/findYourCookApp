# Find Your Cook WebApp

This is our repository for our business idea "Find your Cook".

## Code of Conduct

### Git Workflow
Please use feature branches only to commit your code. 
The reviewer needs to make sure that the features committed are working without errors before approving.
The reviewer shall merge the feature branch into the develop branch once they approved the pull request.
The master branch is only used for production, i.e. a finished deliverable/ work product.




### Naming Branches
Name the branches according to the branch types:
- 👨‍🎨 **Feature**: `feature/xx-yy-zz` -- ease tracking of features. Example: `feature/add-free-slots`
- 🧙‍♀️**Bugfix**: `bugfix/xx-yy-zz` -- fixed bugs.
- 👶 **Minor**: `minor/xx-yy-zz` -- refactorings or something similar.

### Commit messages
Write commit messages based on these [guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) ❤
